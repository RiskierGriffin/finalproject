      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        The Yorkie is a small sized breed.
        It is prized for its appearence and small size. With an average height of 8 inches,
        it is very easy to carry as it will fit in most bags or purses. It requires little
        physical activity and is content with a walk or 2 a day.

      <h2>Versatility</h2>
      <p>
        Yorkies are not good for much else other than being a housepet, and it is notoriously
        difficult to train, often requiring crate-training.
