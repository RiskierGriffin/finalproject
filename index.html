      <h2>What are dogs?</h2>
      <p>
        Dogs are the most abundant terrestrial carnivores.
        Originally descended from wolves, they have since been domesticated.
        They are now a common household pet throughout the world.
        They have an average lifespan of 14 years, and they become deeply
        integrated into their family. Dogs are highly social creatures and have
        the ability to form complex relationships.
