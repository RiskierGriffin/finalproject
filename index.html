      <h2>What are dogs?</h2>
      <p>
        Dogs are the most abundant terrestrial carnivores.
        Originally descended from wolves, they have since been domesticated.
        They are now a common household pet throughout the world.
        They have an average lifespan of 14 years, and they become deeply
        integrated into their family. Dogs are highly social creatures and have
        the ability to form complex relationships.

      <h2>Diet</h2>
      <p>
        Dogs have a versatile diet. They can eat any meat,
        even those that would get humans sick. They can also eat a variety
        of processed food as well, such as peanutbutter. They are notorious
        for putting random food in their mouth, even items that are not meant
        to be eaten.

      <h2>Breeds</h2>
      <p>
        There are a myraid of breeds that dogs can get their genetics from.
        Dogs can weigh anywhere from under 20 pounds to over 150.
        Their fur can be brown, black, white, golden or any combination of these.
        They can have a solid color, be spotted, have stripes or numerous other markings.
        The personality of the dog can be affected by their breed, as some are infamous
        for their aggresivity, such as the pitbull.
        Purebred dogs are valued higher than those with a mixed heritage, altough purebreds
        are far more likely to have medical issues than those with multiple lineages.
